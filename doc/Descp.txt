1. Flow of the application:
The high-level flow of the app and what each class does would be explained as follows:
```
                main.cpp
                └── FileReader:
                    └─ Reads a fixed-size chunk from file
                └── ThreadManager:
                    └─ Submits each chunk to ThreadPool
                        └─ Threads run process_chunk in parallel
                                └─ WordProcessor:
                                    └─ Parses chunk and adds unique words

2. The main threads actually working as follows

          ->  Threads are created in ThreadPool::ThreadPool()

          ->  Tasks are submitted using ThreadPool::enqueue_task()

          ->  Each task calls WordProcessor::process_chunk()

    Each chunk is processed in a separate thread, managed by the thread pool.
